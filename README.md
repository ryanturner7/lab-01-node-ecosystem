401 JS -- Class 01 node ecosystem

 This lab took my about 3 hours. I created a directory called lib which had two modules. These happened to be greet and arithmetic. I also created a test directory which held the tests for the two modules. Greet.js defines function module.export which 'name' is passed through and returns the users name + 'hello' when invoked. Arithmetic.js assigns an empty object to module.exports and our variable arithmetic. Then we use the add and subtract methods to make sure that the input is a number, or else it returns null. After I created these modules, it was time to write tests to make sure that my functions were all working correctly.
